## This is an idea for a script to be implemented in AutoHotKey

main():
# save a reference to existing input control (keyboard focus)
# display window with symbols
# add onSelect hook with key Enter
# add onCancel hook with key Escape

close():
# hide window with symbols
# return keyboard focus to the input control

onSelect():
# close()
# insert selected symbol

onCancel():
# close()
